## Export your Sketch designs as HTML email templates

![Slinky demo](http://cdn.finch.io/public/slinky.gif)

Slinky is a [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) plugin that allows you to export Sketch artboards as ready‚Äìto‚Äìsend HTML e-mail templates.

### Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/finchalyzer/slinky/archive/master.zip), unzip and double-click the **Slinky.sketchplugin** file and let Sketch automatically install the plugin for you
2. Open up your Sketch file and select the Artboard with your template design
3. Go to *Plugins -> Slinky -> Export Selected Artboard* from the Sketch top menu bar
4. Choose the folder where to export the template
5. Voil√†!

We have prepared some *good to go* Sketch templates located in [templates](https://github.com/finchalyzer/slinky/templates) directory just for you üéÅ


## Important Guidelines
Slinky is not perfect _yet_, so to get the best result, there are some things to remember creating you design file:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Images and icons
Slinky will automatically export image and icon assets, but you need to individually mark them as **Exportable**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Links
Go to *Plugins -> Slinky -> Show/Hide Link URL* to show the Slinky link input in the inspector sidebar. Select the target layer and fill the *Link URL* field with the target link or e-mail.
For now this does not work for selected text *(help needed)*.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Fonts
Slinky does not check the template for custom fonts *(yet)* and will export the template as it is. For the safest result across different email clients, we suggest you to use cross-platform fonts only:

- **Sans Serif Safe Fonts**
   - Arial
   - Arial Black
   - Century Gothic
   - Geneva
   - Lucida
   - Lucida Sans
   - Lucida Grande
   - Tahoma
   - Trebuchet MS
   - Verdana

- **Serif Safe Fonts**
   - Courier
   - Courier New
   - Georgia
   - MS Serif
   - Palatino
   - Palatino Linotype
   - Times
   - Times New Roman
